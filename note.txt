A ".txt" file, also known as a "text file," is a common file format used to store plain text data without any special formatting or binary information. These files typically contain human-readable text and can be created and edited using a simple text editor or word processing software.

Text files are used for various purposes, including storing configuration settings, code snippets, documentation, data sets, and more. They are a versatile and widely supported file format that can be easily opened and manipulated by many different software applications on various operating systems.

In a ".txt" file, each line typically represents a separate piece of information or a paragraph of text, and the content is encoded using character encoding standards like ASCII or UTF-8. The ".txt" extension indicates that the file contains plain text, as opposed to binary files that store data in a more complex, non-human-readable format.
